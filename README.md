# Solutions to the "Python Generation: A Beginner's Course" on Stepik

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the ["Python Generation: A Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852) on the [Stepik](https://stepik.org/) platform. It might be useful for those who are also taking the course and looking for examples or inspiration.

## Overview

The repository includes solutions for tasks from each module of the course. The exercises cover a wide range of Python topics, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like working with files, functions, loops, etc.

Each solution is accompanied by comments to explain the logic of the code. **Note**: these solutions may differ from yours, and it's important to try solving the tasks independently for better learning.

## Repository Structure

- **Modules and Lessons**: solutions are grouped by module and lesson numbers.
  - `module_1/`: contains solutions from Module 1
  - `module_2/`: contains solutions from Module 2
  - and so on...

  Inside each folder, you'll find files named after the corresponding exercise or lesson, making it easier to navigate.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheDataWanderer/stepic_python_generation_beginners.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired module and lesson to find the solution you're looking for.

3. Open the solution file to compare it with your own answers or use it as a reference.

## Important Note

These solutions are provided for educational purposes. Do not simply copy the solutions without understanding them - try to solve the exercises on your own first to get the most out of the course.
